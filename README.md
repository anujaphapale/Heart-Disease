Overview:
Heart disease is one of the leading cause of death among all other disease. The machine learning techniques can be adapted to do the prediction of heart disease.
Following machine learning model are developed for prediction of heart disease:
KNN Classifier
Random forest Classifier
SVC Classifier
Navie Baye
XGboost
