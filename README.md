Overview:
Heart disease is one of the leading cause of death among all other disease. The machine learning techniques can be adapted to do the prediction of heart disease.
Following machine learning model are developed for prediction of heart disease:
KNN Classifier
Random forest Classifier
SVC Classifier
Navie Bayes
XGboost

KNN             92%,
Navie Bayes Guassian NB 70%,
Navie Bayes Multinomial NB 62%,
Random Forest 94%,
SVC 75%,
XGBoost 77%,
Decision Tree 71%

Conclusion:
By comparing acuracy of different model Random Forest Classifier model with 94% accuracy is selected to perdict result while depolying project. Project is deployed using streamlit.
